		description:
			'Developed a bidirectional user synchronization process between Microsoft Entra ID and Paylocity using Azure Logic Apps. The workflow retrieves employees from Paylocity via the [Get All Employees API](https://developer.paylocity.com/integrations/reference/get-all-employees) and users from Microsoft Graph with selective filters. Both datasets are stored in arrays, filtered for active/valid users, and compared in a For each loop. For Paylocity, Entra ID values such as `businessPhones` and `userPrincipalName` update `phone` and `emailAddress`. For Entra ID, Paylocity values like `workAddress`, `jobTitle`, `employeeType`, `supervisorEmployeeId`, `employeeId`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `preferredName`, and department (via `customDropDownFields`) are synchronized. This integration ensures accurate and consistent user profiles across both platforms, reducing manual reconciliation and errors.',
