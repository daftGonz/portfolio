The workflow retrieves employees from Paylocity via the [Get All Employees API](https://developer.paylocity.com/integrations/reference/get-all-employees) and users from Microsoft Graph with selective filters. Both datasets are stored in arrays, filtered for active/valid users, and compared in a For each loop. For Paylocity, Entra ID values such as `businessPhones` and `userPrincipalName` update `phone` and `emailAddress`. For Entra ID, Paylocity values like `workAddress`, `jobTitle`, `employeeType`, `supervisorEmployeeId`, `employeeId`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `preferredName`, and department (via `customDropDownFields`) are synchronized. This integration ensures accurate and consistent user profiles across both platforms, reducing manual reconciliation and errors.",shortDescription:"Azure Logic App integration for bidirectional user sync between Microsoft Entra ID and Paylocity via RESTful APIs.",links:[],logo:e.Azure,name:"Entra ID â†” Paylocity Sync",period:{from:new Date},skills:o("json","rest","graph","paylocity","azure"),type:"Integration Project",screenshots:[{label:"Logic App Workflow",src:"/screenshots/entra-paylocity-logicapp.png"},{label:"Source Code Snippet",src:"/screenshots/entra-paylocity-source.png"}]}],a="Projects";export{t as i,a as t};
